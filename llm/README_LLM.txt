Note : there might be errors. Not sure, but the code worked fine for me.

llm.ipynb has covered the following details

-> fetching list of models
-> sentiment analysis
-> json_schema structured output
-> embeddings and sentiment analysis
-> image analysis
-> function calling

base64.ipynb has covered converting strings and images to base64

look at prompt.json for sending structured json prompting. the reuult of this prompt is there in structured.json

embeddings.json is a sample template of response from the model. i have given empty list in place of vector embeddings, because it was very big.

chat.json is a sample of sentiment analysis response without structured json schema output.


pls go through the notebooks before ROE. since there might be errors, it is better to spot before the exam and get it fixed

please install the necessary dependencies.
